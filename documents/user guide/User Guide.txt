|-USER GUIDE FOR ONE MAN, FIREMAN-|
\=================================/

Welcome to the User Guide of the most exciting yet difficult game of all time!
You are the Fireman, the best Fireman. You have been tasked to save the civilians trapped in a burning building caused by a roaring Fire monster.
Everything seems okay till you get trapped inside and are now stuck in this burning inferno.
Will you be able to defeat the boss, save the civilians and live to tell the tale of a hero, or will you perish and get engulfed by the ever-burning fire?

The game consists of three difficulties [Easy, Normal, Hard] and an Endless mode.
Each mode has its own leaderboard, so try your best to reach the top and be the best Fireman!
The game ends when you defeat the boss at the end.

To control your character, use the WASD keys.
To shoot water to extinguish the fire to travel through the burning buildings, use the arrow keys.
Power-ups are dropped throughout the map that will help your journey through the fire a bit more tolerable.
Use Shift together with WASD keys to Sprint. Sprinting will lower your overall score, so use it wisely.
All controls can be changed under Options > Controls.

Dress your Fireman up for style! Play as just a regular Fireman, or play as the 3 other characters that are available, such as:
- The King of the Sea, Ocean Man
- The Conqueror of Space, Astro Man
- The Man To Beat, M.A.N


What are you waiting for? Time waits for noone, especially in this game.
Be the man. Be the Fireman.
